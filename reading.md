## Part 1
1. What is a protocol?
2. What are some examples of protocols?
3. Layered Protocols: the Internet Protocol Stack
4. What do we mean by abstraction? 
5. Many developers can focus only on the Application Layer -> The Web Development Stack, Simplified: Front End, Back End, Database + File System
6. In fact, some only focus on HTTP - and understanding that is barely necessary: you use it
7. So let's compare HTTP to a blockchain
8. Cardano relies on an suite of protocols to run: here's a layered dive!
9. Today, we'll focus only on the Front End --> Goals of this CSK
10. Here's the list of tools we'll use; we'll also make an API call
