## Part 2: Party Like It's 1999
1. If you're brand new to GitHub, take a look at [CSK #001](https://workshopmaybe.com/learn/cardano-starter-kits/starter-kit-001/starter-kit-001a/)
2. Follow along with [this video]()
3. When you're ready, copy the template repository [CSK #003a](https://github.com/GimbaLabs/csk003a) to your GitHub account

## Part 3: You Have Superpowers
I find that preparing to make software is much harder than writing the code itself. In this part, we're going to take a whirlwind tour of how to get ready to build something.

The tools we'll use are choices, and we could choose others ([except perhaps for Node.js](https://medium.com/techinpieces/a-world-without-node-js-12fec4b18733)). Here, I'm choosing tools that are popular and accessible. If you're wondering what else is out there, follow that curiosity! Soon, you'll be replacing your Netflix diet by reading documentation and watching tutorial videos on all the different options.

1. Learn by doing: today we will use the command line
2. Searching, copying + pasting, and asking the right questions.
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), or read the [Visual Studio Code tutorial on Node](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)
4. Check versions: Git, Node, npm
5. Viewing HTML files
6. Running JavaScript files using Node

### Extensions:
- Take a look at the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- Learn more about [Node at The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs)
- Learn more about the [Command Line at codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) or at [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics)
- Read about [installing the Cardano node from source](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/getting-started/install.html), and join us on Discord to ask questions.

## Part 4: Let's Build an App!
1. Create React App
2. Bootstrap (document these steps)
3. Axios
4. What we're doing

Note the role of npm, want to go down that rabbit hole?
Note that "hooks" are new, and were actually hard to learn, because devs had to unlearn certain things. You could say you're at an advantage if you're new here.

### Extensions:
- Style your app to make it look better
- Add a different font
- Call additional data from Messari.io and add it to the app

### Challenge:
- Access your GitHub account from the command line and deploy your App to GitHub Pages. Here's an example. If enough people try this, I'll make a video about it.
