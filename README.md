## Part 2: Party Like It's 1999
1. If you're brand new to GitHub, take a look at [CSK #001](https://github.com/workshop-maybe/sk01-leave-your-mark)
2. When you're ready, clone the repository [CSK #003a](https://github.com/workshop-maybe/sk003a)
3. Enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and just like that, you have a web page!
4. Edit the HTML - let's go to [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
5. Style the HTML with CSS
6. Import a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
7. Use JavaScript to add some interactivity and program logic

### Extensions: 
- Add an image to this page
- Embed a YouTube video to this page
- Take a look at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript

## Part 3: Getting Ready is the Hardest Part
Call it a personal opinion, but I find that preparing to make software is much harder than writing the code itself. In this part, we're going to take a whirlwind tour of how to get ready to build something.

The tools we'll use are choices, and we could easily make others. Here, I'm choosing tools that are popular and accessible. If you're curious about what else is out there, more power to you! Soon, you'll be replacing your Netflix diet with how-to videos on all the different options.

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Command line basics
3. Install Node
4. Check versions: Git, Node, npm

### Extensions:
- Access your GitHub account from the command line

## Part 4: Let's Build an App!
1. Create React App
2. Bootstrap (document these steps)
3. Axios
4. What we're doing

Note the role of npm, want to go down that rabbit hole?
Note that "hooks" are new, and were actually hard to learn, because devs had to unlearn certain things. You could say you're at an advantage if you're new here.

### Extensions:
- Style your app to make it look better
- Add a different font
- Call additional data from Messari.io and add it to the app
