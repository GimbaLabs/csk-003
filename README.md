# Cardano Starter Kit #003
## Where Does Blockchain Fit in the Development Stack?

This CSK is an experiment in mobilizing people to get started on building web apps. If successful, this starter kit will help to demystify app development a bit, and give you context for what "front end" web development means.

## Intended Audience
You should use this Cardano Starter Kit if
- You're brand new to web development and need a place to start
- You have ideas for businesses and Dapps to be built on Cardano, and you're trying to get an idea of what that might entail

## Learning Targets
- I understand the role of a blockchain protocol in a development stack.
- I can describe the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.
- I can use GitHub Pages to publish a basic web page.
- I can set up a development environment on my computer.
- I can create a web app that calls on and displays external data based on user input.

## Outcomes
At the end of this Cardano Starter Kit, you will
- Know enough about development to understand what you need when you have an idea that you want to build.
- Be on your journey toward learning more about building web apps.

## Part 1: Introduction
- CSK videos are currently hosted on [YouTube](http://youtube.com)
- Deck: pdf and Markdown files are here
- Solutions are provided, but of course it's better not to look

## Part 2: Party Like It's 1999
To prepare to build a modern app, let's go back in time to build a basic web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
1. If you're brand new to GitHub, take a look at [CSK #001](https://workshopmaybe.com/learn/cardano-starter-kits/starter-kit-001/starter-kit-001a/)
2. Follow along with [this video]()
3. As shown in the video, you'll copy the template repository [CSK #003a](https://github.com/GimbaLabs/csk003a) to your GitHub account

## Part 3: Now We're Cooking
[Accompanying video on YouTube]()

When you're getting started, you might find that preparing to make software is harder than writing the code itself. Let's take a whirlwind tour of how to set up an environment where we can build something.

The tools we'll use are choices, and we could choose others ([except perhaps for Node.js](https://medium.com/techinpieces/a-world-without-node-js-12fec4b18733)). In Parts 3 and 4 of this CSK, I'm choosing tools that are popular and accessible. If you're wondering what else is out there, follow that curiosity! Soon, you'll be replacing your Netflix diet with reading documentation and watching tutorial videos on all the different options.

1. Learn by doing: today we will use the command line
2. Real developer skills: searching, copying + pasting, and [asking the right questions](https://stackoverflow.com/).
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. In Visual Studio Code, clone the CSK #003a repo from GitHub and view the HTML files
5. On the command line, check versions of Node, npm and git
6. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), or read the [Visual Studio Code tutorial on Node](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)
7. Running JavaScript files using Node

### Extensions:
- Take a look at the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- Learn more about [Node at The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs)
- Learn more about the [Command Line at codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) or at [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics)
- Read about [installing the Cardano node from source](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/getting-started/install.html).

### How you can help:
- [Join us on Discord to ask questions and give feedback](https://discord.gg/dErH6vS). What sorts of documentation would you like to see here?
- Create a video about how to set up Visual Studio Code and Node on Windows

## Part 4: Building an Interactive App with React, Bootstrap, and Axios
Now that your development environment is ready, let's build an app.
